# Socket
Looking for and creating something interesting about socket and C.

Based on the code [server.c](http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/server.c) and the book [Beej's Guide to Network](http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) we implemented a chat function so that the server and client can enjoy their chat.
